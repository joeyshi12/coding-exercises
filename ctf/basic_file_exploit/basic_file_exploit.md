# Basic File Exploit

On line 143, if the given entry is 0, then the program will output the flag.
Reading entries is guarded in line 180 until `inputs != 0`. `inputs` refers to
the number of entries written since the start of the program.

Thus, writing `1, 1` into entry 1 and then reading entry 0 will retrieve the flag.
