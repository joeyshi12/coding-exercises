# Basketball
You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play one of two games.
1. You get 1 shot to make the hoop
2. You get 3 shots and you have to make 2 of 3 shots

If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p should
you pick one game over the other?

## Solution
Case 1: P(shot) = p
Case 2: P(shot) = p*p + (1-p)*p*p + p*(1-p)*p = 3p^2 - 2p^3

p > 3p^2 - 2p^3
2p^3 - 3p^2 + p > 0
p(2p^2 - 3p + 1) > 0
p(p-1)(2p-1) > 0 => p in (0, 0.5)

(1) should be picked when p in (0, 0.5) and (2) should be picked when p in (0.5, 1).
Otherwise, either choice yields the same P(shot).
