# The Heavy Pill

You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight
1.1 grams. Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy
bottle? You can only use the scale once.


## Solution

Order the bottles $b_{1},\dots, b_{20}$. For each bottle $b_i$, place $i$ pills onto the scale.
Suppose $b_n$ is the bottle containing the 1.1 gram pills. Then, the total weight on the
scale is $w = 1 + \cdots + 1.1 * n + ... + 20 = (1 + ... + 20) + 0.1 * n$. Then,
$$n = 10(w - 20*21/2) = 10(w - 210)$$
